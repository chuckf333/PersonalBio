    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>
        I grew up with both parents having Computer Science degrees, so I've always
        been around computers and other technologies.  My experience in programming
        is fairly limited, but after so many years of working in jobs that have not
        taken me anywhere significant, I believe that the best option for building a
        future for myself is in the tech world.  I'm not really sure what I want to
        do with any of this yet, but I'm hoping that something will jump out at me
        while I'm studying here at Chico.
